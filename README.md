This repository contains some of the projects I completed in my CIS 310 SQL class. Throughout the course, I worked on designing and managing databases using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and writing SQL queries to interact with relational databases.

Key highlights include:

Designing ERDs to model real-world database systems

Writing SQL statements for data retrieval (SELECT), insertion (INSERT), updates (UPDATE), and deletion (DELETE)

Creating and modifying tables, relationships, and constraints

Practicing JOINs, aggregate functions, and subqueries

These projects reflect my growing skills in database design and SQL programming.
